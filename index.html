            A diamond is made to be worn, admired, and enjoyed. It doesn't represent just a worn piece of jewelry. Beyond aesthetics and symbolism, a diamond embodies value. It is a combination of artistic talent, patience, love, and skills beyond comprehension with rare gems and precious metal. Diamond jewelry designs can be simple and classic, elegant and sophisticated, or bold and provocative. They may be inspired by a variety of sources. In a deep and profound way, they can also reflect the identities and personalities of those who wear the jewelry. Such commitment HRK Diamonds pledges to its clients. Founded in 2015, in Rome - Italy, the brand has constantly strived to achieve such excellence. Starting with a small retail business in Rome, it rapidly expanded due to the strong character of the design, and the unmatched quality. We have presented our brands not only in Italy, but so far also in Belgium, Switzerland, Austria and soon London and United States.
